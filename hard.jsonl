British English speakers typically use \"autumn.\"\n\n2. Cultural Activity – \"pumpkin painting day\":  \n   Pumpkin-related activities are strongly associated with Halloween and fall traditions in the United States and Canada. Hosting a neighborhood event like this suggests a suburban or family-oriented community, which is common in many parts of the U.S.\n\n3. Language and Tone:  \n   The casual, friendly tone and use of contractions (\"we hosted,\" \"i swear\") are typical of American online discourse. The lowercase \"i\" may indicate informal typing habits, common in casual Reddit comments.\n\n4. Climate Clue – \"sidewalk was orange for a week\":  \n   This implies outdoor activity in fall weather, which suggests a temperate climate where outdoor events are still feasible in the fall. This would likely exclude the far north (e.g., parts of Canada or northern U.S. states where it might already be too cold or snowy in late fall) and the deep south where fall might not be as distinctly celebrated.\n\n5.
